    <p>Pakistan (Urdu: پاکِستان [ˈpaːkɪstaːn]),[d] officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (اِسلامی جمہوریہ
        پاکِستان),
        is a country in South Asia. It is the world's fifth-most populous country, with a population of almost 243
        million
        people, and has the world's second-largest Muslim population just behind Indonesia.[18] Pakistan is the
        33rd-largest
        country in the world by area and 2nd largest in South Asia, spanning 881,913 square kilometres (340,509 square
        miles). It has a 1,046-kilometre (650-mile) coastline along the Arabian Sea and Gulf of Oman in the south, and
        is
        bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest, and China to the northeast. It is
        separated narrowly from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime
        border
        with Oman. Islamabad is the nation's capital, while Karachi is its largest city and financial centre.

        Pakistan is the site of several ancient cultures, including the 8,500-year-old Neolithic site of Mehrgarh in
        Balochistan,[19] the Indus Valley civilisation of the Bronze Age, the most extensive of the civilisations of the
        Afro-Eurasia,[20][21] and the ancient Gandhara civilization.[22] The region that comprises the modern state of
        Pakistan
        was the realm of multiple empires and dynasties, including the Achaemenid; briefly that of Alexander the Great;
        the
        Seleucid, the Maurya, the Kushan, the Gupta;[23] the Umayyad Caliphate in its southern regions, the Hindu
        Shahis, the
        Ghaznavids, the Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals,[24] the Durranis, the Sikh Empire, British East India Company
        rule, and
        most recently, the British Indian Empire from 1858 to 1947.

        Spurred by the Pakistan Movement, which sought a homeland for the Muslims of British India, and election
        victories in 1946 by the All-India Muslim League, Pakistan gained independence in 1947 after the Partition of
        the British Indian Empire, which awarded separate statehood to its Muslim-majority regions and was accompanied
        by an unparalleled mass migration and loss of life.[25] Initially a Dominion of the British Commonwealth,
        Pakistan officially drafted its constitution in 1956, and emerged as a declared Islamic republic. In 1971, the
        exclave of East Pakistan seceded as the new country of Bangladesh after a nine-month-long civil war. In the
        following four decades, Pakistan has been ruled by governments whose descriptions, although complex, commonly
        alternated between civilian and military, democratic and authoritarian, relatively secular and Islamist.[26]
        Pakistan elected a civilian government in 2008, and in 2010 adopted a parliamentary system with periodic
        elections.[27]

        Pakistan is a middle power nation,[28][29][30][31][32][33] and has the world's sixth-largest standing armed
        forces. It
        is a declared nuclear-weapons state, and is ranked amongst the emerging and growth-leading economies,[34] with a
        large
        and rapidly-growing middle class.[35] Pakistan's political history since independence has been characterised by
        periods
        of significant economic and military growth as well as those of political and economic instability. It is an
        ethnically
        and linguistically diverse country, with similarly diverse geography and wildlife. The country continues to face
        challenges, including poverty, illiteracy, corruption and terrorism.[36] Pakistan is a member of the United
        Nations, the
        Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth of Nations, the
        South Asian
        Association for Regional Cooperation, and the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition, and is designated as
        a major
        non-NATO ally by the United States.</p>

    <h1 id="history"> History</h1>
    <p>The history of preceding the country's independence in 1947[1] is shared with that of Afghanistan, India, and
        Iran. Spanning the western expanse of the Indian subcontinent and the eastern borderlands of the Iranian
        plateau, the region of present-day Pakistan served both as the fertile ground of a major civilization and as the
        gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East.[2][3]

        Situated on the first coastal migration route of Homo sapiens out of Africa, the region was inhabited early by
        modern humans.[4][5] The 9,000-year history of village life in South Asia traces back to the Neolithic
        (7000–4300 BCE) site of Mehrgarh in Pakistan,[6][7][8] and the 5,000-year history of urban life in South Asia to
        the various sites of the Indus Valley Civilization, including Mohenjo Daro and Harappa.[9][10]

        The ensuing millennia saw the region of present-day Pakistan absorb many influences—represented among others in
        the
        ancient, mainly Hindu-Buddhist, sites of Taxila, and Takht-i-Bahi, the 14th-century Islamic-Sindhi monuments of
        Thatta,
        and the 17th-century Mughal monuments of Lahore. In the first half of the 19th century, the region was
        appropriated by
        the East India Company, followed, after 1857, by 90 years of direct British rule, and ending with the creation
        of
        Pakistan in 1947, through the efforts, among others, of its future national poet Allama Iqbal and its founder,
        Muhammad
        Ali Jinnah. Since then, the country has experienced both civilian-democratic and military rule, resulting in
        periods of
        significant economic and military growth as well those of instability; significant during the latter, was the
        secession
        of East Pakistan as the new nation of Bangladesh.</p>

    <h1 id="bottom">Early and medieval age</h1>
    <p>Some of the earliest ancient human civilisations in South Asia originated from areas encompassing present-day
        Pakistan.[43] The earliest known inhabitants in the region were Soanian during the Lower Paleolithic, of whom
        stone tools have been found in the Soan Valley of Punjab.[44] The Indus region, which covers most of present day
        Pakistan, was the site of several successive ancient cultures including the Neolithic Mehrgarh[45] and the
        Bronze Age Indus Valley civilisation[46][47] (2,800–1,800 BCE) at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro.[48]

        The Vedic period (1500–500 BCE) was characterised by an Indo-Aryan culture; during this period the Vedas, the
        oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism, were composed, and this culture later became well established in the
        region.[49] Multan was an important Hindu pilgrimage centre.[50] The Vedic civilisation flourished in the
        ancient Gandhāran city of Takṣaśilā, now Taxila in the Punjab, which was founded around 1000 BCE.[51][45]
        Successive ancient empires and kingdoms ruled the region: the Persian Achaemenid Empire (around 519 BCE),
        Alexander the Great's empire in 326 BCE[52] and the Maurya Empire, founded by Chandragupta Maurya and extended
        by Ashoka the Great, until 185 BCE. The Indo-Greek Kingdom founded by Demetrius of Bactria (180–165 BCE)
        included Gandhara and Punjab and reached its greatest extent under Menander (165–150 BCE), prospering the
        Greco-Buddhist culture in the region.[45][53] Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher
        education in the world, which was established during the late Vedic period in 6th century BCE.[54][55] The
        school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious
        instruction was provided on an individualistic basis.[55] The ancient university was documented by the invading
        forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE.[56]

        At its zenith, the Rai Dynasty (489–632 CE) of Sindh ruled this region and the surrounding territories.[57] The
        Pala Dynasty was the last Buddhist empire, which, under Dharmapala and Devapala, stretched across South Asia
        from what is now Bangladesh through Northern India to Pakistan.</p>

            Greco-Buddhist culture in the region.[45][53] Taxila had one of the earliest universities and centres of higher
            education in the world, which was established during the late Vedic period in 6th century BCE.[54][55] The
            school consisted of several monasteries without large dormitories or lecture halls where the religious
            instruction was provided on an individualistic basis.[55] The ancient university was documented by the invading
            forces of Alexander the Great and was also recorded by Chinese pilgrims in the 4th or 5th century CE.[56]
    
            At its zenith, the Rai Dynasty (489–632 CE) of Sindh ruled this region and the surrounding territories.[57] The
            Pala Dynasty was the last Buddhist empire, which, under Dharmapala and Devapala, stretched across South Asia
            from what is now Bangladesh through Northern India to Pakistan.</p>
